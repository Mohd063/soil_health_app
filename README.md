## üì° Bluetooth Assumptions
- The app currently uses mock data for Bluetooth readings
- For real implementation, you would need to:
  - Add Bluetooth permissions to `AndroidManifest.xml`
  - Implement actual Bluetooth device scanning and connection
  - Parse the data format from your specific device
  - The `BluetoothService` class is structured to make this transition straightforward
